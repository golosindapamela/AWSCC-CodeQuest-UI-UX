&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: The Shopee website is much easier to use when looking for a product. Besides having a categories section on the website, Shopee's search option is more emphasized than Lazada's, which gives it an advantage by directly and easily attracting the user's attention to use it.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Unnecessary pop-ups or floating elements can be major distractions. These, when accidentally clicked, may redirect users to another website or a different section of the current site, causing confusion.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platforms’ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: The organization of content in both Lazada and Shopee is commendable, featuring well-defined sections for categories, flash deals/sales, and more. However, when comparing which platform's content is easier to scan and understand, Shopee holds the advantage. Shopee employs a thoughtful use of color and shapes to distinguish between sections, making it visually easier for users to identify and navigate through the different parts of the website.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websites’ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee's website really sticks to its brand, using a lot of orange everywhere. This makes it not just look consistent but also nice to look at for people shopping or browsing. They've made their site easy to use and nice to look at with bright colors and a clear layout. On the other hand, Lazada's website looks more on the simple side. It's neat and professional but doesn't really show off its brand colors or any special design bits that make you think of Lazada right away. This might make it less catchy or memorable compared to Shopee. If Lazada added more of its brand stuff into its website's look, it might make the site more interesting and together.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Both websites demonstrate strong responsiveness across different devices. Shopee and Lazada have designed their websites to automatically adjust to the size of your screen. Everything, from the text to the pictures, changes size to fit better, making shopping on a small phone screen just as easy as on a big computer monitor.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: For me, Shopee looks better visually. It's really consistent with its branding, especially with the orange color they use a lot. This makes the website not just good to look at but also easy to remember. It's easier to get around the site too, which is great. On the other hand, Lazada's website doesn't stand out as much. It's neat and professional, sure, but it doesn't really show off any special colors or designs that make you think of Lazada right away. So, it might not stick in your mind as much.

It's a fun and challenging game that triggers both my inner competitiveness and patience.
